<h1>About gpg4usb</h1>
<p>To say it straight in only one sentence: gpg4usb is a very easy to use portable-application, which combines 
a simple text-editor with a <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/" title="GnuPG">GnuPG</a>-frontend to write, encrypt and 
decrypt your text-messages and files. gpg4usb should work on almost any computer you're working on, should it be a 
Linux-machine or even one with a Microsoft-OS running.<br /><br />
Almost the only thing required is an available usb-port you are allowed to access. With this application you 
can write safe and encrypted messages anywhere you are: should it be an internet-cafe, at work or somewhere else
 on holiday... and you always have the encryption-keys available for usage!<br /><br />
The usage of gpg4usb should be highly self-describing, since the user-interface and all the options it offers
are clear cut: Simply execute the binary on your usb-pendrive and start typing e.g. the Mailtext you want to
be encrypted. If you're done, choose the right gpg/pgp-key for the person you are writing to and hit the 
encrypt-icon at the top of the application-window. The resulting encrypted text you can save as a text-file to send
it as mail-attachment, or copy it directly into your mail-user-agent or webmail-website. To make sure, 
you can read this message by yourself afterwards, encrypt it for the recipient and to yourself at the same time - if you 
want, you can mark as much keys as you want to encrypt for.<br /><br />
You want to add a gpg/pgp-key to your mobile keyring? Nothing's easier than that: just hit the <em>crypto</em>-menue-entry and
choose <em>Import Key from File</em> or <em>Import Key from Editor</em>. This means that it's possible to 
import an ascii-armored pubkey via file-dialog, or via copy&amp;paste into your editor-window. If you find a 
key e.g. on a website, just copy it, paste it into the gpg4usb-editor and hit <em>Import Key from Editor</em> - that's it, 
and the key shows up on your keyring!<br /><br />    
We are trying to let things work as easy as possible. If you have any problems with this application, if 
you don't know how to handle it, or if you find any bugs: <a href="contact.php" title="Contact us">Please contact us!</a></p>
