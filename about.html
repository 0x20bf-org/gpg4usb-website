<h1>About gpg4usb</h1>
<p>To say it straight in only one sentence: gpg4usb is a very easy to use portable-application, which combines 
a simple text-editor with a <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/" title="GnuPG">GnuPG</a>-frontend to write, encrypt and 
decrypt your text-messages and files. gpg4usb should work on almost any computer you're working on, should it be a 
Linux-machine or even one with a Microsoft-OS running.<br /><br />
Almost the only thing required is an available usb-port you are allowed to access. With this application you 
can write safe and encrypted messages anywhere you are: should it be an internet-cafe, at work or somewhere else
 on holiday... and you always have the encryption-keys available for usage!<br /><br />
The usage of gpg4usb should be highly self-describing, since the user-interface and all the options it offers
are clear cut: Simply execute the binary on your usb-pendrive and start typing e.g. the Mailtext you want to
be encrypted. If you're done, choose the right gpg/pgp-key for the person you are writing to and hit the 
encrypt-icon at the top of the application-window. The resulting encrypted text you can save as a text-file to send
it as mail-attachment, or copy it directly into your mail-user-agent or webmail-website. To make sure, 
you can read this message by yourself afterwards, encrypt it for the recipient and to yourself at the same time - if you 
want, you can mark as much keys as you want to encrypt for.<br /><br />
You want to add a gpg/pgp-key to your mobile keyring? Nothing's easier than that: just hit the <em>crypto</em>-menue-entry and
choose <em>Import Key from File</em> or <em>Import Key from Editor</em>. This means that it's possible to 
import an ascii-armored pubkey via file-dialog, or via copy&amp;paste into your editor-window. If you find a 
key e.g. on a website, just copy it, paste it into the gpg4usb-editor and hit <em>Import Key from Editor</em> - that's it, 
and the key shows up on your keyring!<br /><br />    
We are trying to let things work as easy as possible. If you have any problems with this application, if
