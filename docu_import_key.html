<h1>Howto import keys</h1>
<p>
There are second respectively three steps for importing public keys. We assume, that Bobby wants to import Alice's key, so that he is able to encrypt messages to her. 
<br/>
When Bobby wants to import a key from text-edit field or from clipboard, he first has to copy the key to it.
</p>
<h4>STEP 1: Open key import dialog</h4>
<p>
First Bobby opens the import key dialog through the toolbar.

</p>

<h4>STEP 2: Choose keys</h4>
<p>
Secondly makes the appropriate selection. If he wants to import a key from editor, he has to paste the key to the text-edit field before. Only if he wants to import keys from file, he has to do the next step, otherwise he's done.

<h4>STEP 3: Choose file</h4>
<p>
