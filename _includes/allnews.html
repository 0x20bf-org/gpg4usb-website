	<div class="box_title">2012-09-10:</div> 
	<div class="box_content"><p>We received some hints that the default key generation settings are not sufficient anymore.
	Gpg4usb was still generating DSA/El-Gamal Keys. Here is a press report of an experiment breaking a 932bit El-Gamal Crypto Key with 21
	personal computers (252 cores) in 148.2 days <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/news/pr/archives/month/2012/20120618-01.html" title="Fujitsu: Breaking El-Gamal Crypto Key">
	[link]</a>.</p> 
	<p>So we finally put out a release which generates safer keys by default. Also it was suggested to us that keys should expire by
	default, as they may get closer to beeing breakable with time. So we now set a default expiration date of 5 years. You could still
	change this setting yourself.</p>

	<p>Changes: </p>
<ul>
  		<li>Updated included gpg binary to version 1.4.12</li>
  		<li>In key creation we changed the following
    <ul>
	    <li>Set keytype to RSA instead of DSA/El-Gamal</li>
	    <li>Set expiration to five years by default</li>
	    <li>Set minimum keysize to 1024 bit</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
</ul>

	<p>Bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Fix creation of empty Windows registry key on import from existing GnuPG</li>
</ul>

	<div class="box_content"><p>Although gpg4usb 0.3.2 has a wizard, it did not arise magically out of nothing. 
	We put some work in a first start wizard, an offline help system and did bug fixing as usual (same procedure as every release).</p>
	<p>Our translators worked hard on bringing your localized versions. 0.3.2 comes with nine languages, 
	the latest localisation is Arabic which was done by Ahmad (cheerio to him).</p>
	<p><img src="./pics/gpg4usb-0.3.2-arabic.jpg" alt="gpg4usb arabic translation" /></p>
	<p>Unfortunately we had to remove italian localisation, since it wasn't updated since 0.2.5 and is really outdated now. 
	If someone likes to step in, the italian language files are still available. Since we didn't receive updated 
	Vietnamese and Burmese translations yet, these are still like version 0.3.1, so the new features are not translated.</p>

<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
		<li>First start wizard with posibility to 
	<ul>
			<li>create new key</li>
			<li>import config and keys from old version</li>

		<li>Integrated offline help system</li>
		<li>Dialog with result of key import</li>
		<li>Key details dialog more user friendly</li>
		<li>Zoomable text area</li>
		<li>File operation toolbar</li>
		<li>Added Arabian translation</li>
</ul>

	<p>Minor changes:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Build with Qt 4.8</li>
		<li>Strike out revoked keys in keylist and add warning to keydetails dialog</li>
		<li>Change default iconsize to 24x24</li>
		<li>Show selection for keyring files in import dialog</li>
		<li>Understandable message if no private key found for decryption</li>
		<li>Add button to copy fingerprint in key detail dialog and remove whitespaces on copy</li>
		<li>Automatically restart gpg4usb on language change</li>
		<li>Change file encryption to single dialogs for en- and decryption</li>
		<li>Disable tab related actions when no tab is shown</li>
</ul>

	<p>Bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Fix crash on canceling password dialog on Windows</li>

	<div class="box_content"><p>Summer, sun and new release. Within not quite a month we present you 
	the result of newest polishing and bug-fixing. Viriato showed up and was so kind to provide a spanish 
	translation. Many thanks to him and the other translators for updating the translation files.</p>

	<p>Added features in version 0.2.4:</p>
<ul>
      <li>Open file from command line</li>
      <li>Added setting to save checked private keys on exit <br/>(kind of "encrypt to self"-behaviour)</li>
      <li>Added link to online-tutorial in help menu</li>
		<li>Added spanish translation</li>
		<li>Added undo to edit-menu</li>	
</ul>
	<p>The following bugfixes/changes were made in version 0.2.4:</p>
<ul>
        <li>In save-dialog on exit, don't exit, if cancel is hit.</li>
		<li>Fixed multilingual and multiplatform behaviour of shortcuts.</li>
		<li>Statically build with Qt 4.5 on Debian Sarge again, so it should run on rather old Linux-Distris</li>
		<li>From now on the download files are <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/" title="upx-compression">upx-compressed</a> by default</li>
</ul>
	<p>Furthermore we started the implementation of PGP-MIME-parsing. This implementation is rather incomplete.
	We're not sure, if it's working under all circumstances. Also we're not yet satisfied with the GUI, 
	so we marked it experimental in the settings dialog. If this warning is not keeping you away from testing, 
	and you find errors or non-working PGP-MIME encoded messages, don't hesitate to report.
