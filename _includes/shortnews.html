<div class="box_content"><p>We received some hints that the default key generation settings are not sufficient anymore.
	Gpg4usb was still generating DSA/El-Gamal Keys. Here is a press report of an experiment breaking a 932bit El-Gamal Crypto Key with 21
	personal computers (252 cores) in 148.2 days <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/news/pr/archives/month/2012/20120618-01.html" title="Fujitsu: Breaking El-Gamal Crypto Key">
	[link]</a>.</p> 
	<p>
	So we finally put out a release which generates safer keys by default. Also it was suggested to us that keys should expire by
	default, as they may get closer to beeing breakable with time. So we now set a default expiration date of 5 years. You could still
	change this setting yourself.</p>

<p>Changes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated included gpg binary to version 1.4.12</li>
  <li>In key creation we changed the following
	<ul>
		<li>Set keytype to RSA instead of DSA/El-Gamal</li>
		<li>Set expiration to five years by default</li>
		<li>Set minimum keysize to 1024 bit</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Bugfixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix creation of empty Windows registry key on import from existing GnuPG</li>
</ul>
