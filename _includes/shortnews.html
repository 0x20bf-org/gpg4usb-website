        <strong>New stable Release 0.3.3</strong><br/>
    <ul>        
        <li>gpg4usb-0.3.3 fixes a bug which made private key export impossible, 
            when gpg4usb was started from a path containing non ascii characters</li>
        <li>this release contains greek translation, thanks a lot to George</li>
        <li>the gpg.conf was modified according to 
            <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#sha1">the apache gnupg 
            recommondations</a> to avoid the use of sha1</li>  
        <li>we have bundled gnupg 1.4.16 with release 0.3.2-1. This gnupg version 
            fixes a DoS Bug, see 
            <a href="http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2013q4/000334.html">announcement 0.4.15</a>, 
            and also an interesting attack, which allowed to sniff a private key 
            with a mobilephone ;-) look at 
            <a href="http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2013q4/000337.html">announcement 0.4.16</a>
