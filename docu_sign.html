<h1>Howto sign a message</h1>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> You can only sign messages, if you have one private key, the file is encrypted for. You can identify the private keys by the "bunch of keys"-image in front of the name in the keylist (in this case Bobby):</p>

There are three four for encrypting a text. We assume, that Bobby wants to sign a message. 
After this everyone who has his public key can verify the message and ensure, that the message wasn't modified.

<h4>STEP 1/2: Write the message and check key</h4>
<p>
First Bobby writes the message to the textedit-field. Then he checks his private key in the keylist.

<h4>STEP 4: Enter passphrase</h4>
<p>
Now Bobby enters the passphrase of his private key.<br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> You can only sign messages, if you have a private key. The private keys are those, with the key-icon in front of the Name in the keylist.
