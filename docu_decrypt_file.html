<h1>Howto decrypt a file</h1>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> You can only decrypt files, if you have one private key, the file is encrypted for. You can identify the private keys by the "bunch of keys"-image in front of the name in the keylist (in this case Bobby):</p>

There are five steps to decrypt a file. We assume, that Alice wants to decrypt a file, which is encrypted for her (that is, while encrytion her key was chosen).
</p>
<h4>STEP 1: Open file en-/decryption dialog </h4>
<p>
First Alice chooses the file cryption dialog in the menu. Alternatively, she could just hit the "File-Cryption"-button in the toolbar.

<h4>STEP 3: Choose input-/outputfile</h4>
<p>
Now she chooses the input- and outputfile. The inputfile has to be the encrypted file

<p>
Now she enters the passphrase of her key and hits the ok-button.
