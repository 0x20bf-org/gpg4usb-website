<h1>Howto decrypt a text</h1>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> You can only decrypt files, if you have one private key, the file is encrypted for. You can identify the private keys by the "bunch of keys"-image in front of the name in the keylist (in this case Bobby):</p>

<p>
There are five steps for encrypting a text. We assume, that Bobby wants to decrypt a text, which is encrypted with his public key.
</p>
<h4>STEP 1: Copy the text to the textedit-field</h4>
<p>
First Bobby copies the text to the textedit-field.
</p>

</p>

<h4>STEP 2: Choose key(s)</h4>
<p>
Secondly he chooses his own key.

</p>


<h4>STEP 3: Decrypt message</h4>
<p>
Now Bobby hits the decrypt button to decrypt the text. Alternatively he could use the shortcut Ctrl+D or use the menu crypto->decrypt.<br/>
<b>NOTE:</b> You can only decrypt texts, for which you have the private key. The private keys are those, with the key-icon in front of the Name in the keylist.

<h4>STEP 4: Enter passphrase</h4>
<p>
Now Bobby enters the passphrase of his key.
</p>

</p>


<h4>STEP 5: Read the text</h4>
<p>
Now Bobby can read the encrypted text.
