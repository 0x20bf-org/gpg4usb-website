<h1>Welcome to the gpg4usb project</h1>
<p>gpg4usb is a very easy to use and small portable editor to encrypt and decrypt any text-message or -file
you want.<br /><br />
Our aim is, to give anyone the possibility to send and receive secure encrypted messages anywhere -
on any computer out there, no matter if Microsoft Windows<font size="-3"><sup>(TM)</sup></font> or Linux <!--or *BSD --> is running on it.
Therefore it's usage is self-describing, and the user-interface as simple as possible.<br /><br />
gpg4usb is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">free software</a>, and it is licensed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>. <br /><br />
If you want to give it a try, please get our latest release <a href="gpg4usb-0.3.1.1.zip">here</a> 
or visit our <a href="download.html">download section</a>, get the files and
unzip it onto your usb-pendrive... et voilà: you're done and ready to go!</p>

	<p><strong>2011-12-18:</strong>
	We added translation for Burmese. Thanks a lot to Russel, 
	who has send us translation files for the beautiful Burmese language. </p>
	<p><img src="img/gpg4usb-0.3.1.1-burmese.jpg" alt="gpg4usb burmese translation" /></a></p>
	<p>To use Burmese language, the appropriate font has to be installed on the system, 
	e.g. the Myanmar3 Unicode font on Windows. On linux, this font is contained in the ttf-sil-padauk package. </p>

<div class="newsentry">
	<p><strong>2011-11-19:</strong>
	Due to bug in signing UTF-8 encoded messages we provide a bugfix release 0.3.1.1. 
	So you won't get text like "??????" anymore when signing unicode messages. 
	Get it from the <a href="download.html">download</a> section.

<p><strong>2011-01-19:</strong> 0.3.0 released! Gpg4usb supports tabs in the text editor now.
This eases working on several documents - you could write your response and have the email opened in the same window.
As we imagined this a better way of handling documents, we decided to go for the next major number. 
Due to the great and quick work of our translaters, the application is available in six different languages. 
If you want to provide your language, examine the <a href="docu_translate.html">translation documentation</a>. 
Take a look at the <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> and download <a href="download.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabbed text editor</li>
<li>Quote action, allowing email style reply</li>
<li>Add keyfiles to keylist via drag'n'drop</li>
</ul>
<p>Bugfixes and changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the Windows Qt library to 4.7</li>
<li>Warn before overwriting existing files in file encryption</li>
<li>List keys in deletion dialog</li>
<li>Encrypt and decrypt undoable</li>
<li>Allow decryption of empty messages</li>

<p><strong>2010-12-01:</strong> 0.2.5 is out! We proudly present
you a shiny new settings dialog. Its now possible to remember password for
a session and messages encoded "quoted printable" are decoded now. 
Viriato was so kind to send us an italian translation.
The still experimental "decode PGP/MIME" feature allows to open attachments with the 
responsible application. Also we fixed some long outstanding bugs and updated 
gpg-binaries to the latest version. 
Take a look at the <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> or proceed directly to
the <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

<p>Many thanks to our translators for the smooth and quick translation process short before release again. You are great!</p>

<ul>
<li>Tabbed settings dialog</li>
<li>Redo action in edit menu</li>
<li>Optional "remember password" function</li>
<li>Italian translation</li>
<li>Decoding "quoted printable" works now</li>
<li>PGP/MIME attachments provide "open with external application" now.

<li>Ask before overwriting existing files in file encryption</li>
<li>Syncronize checked keys between file encryption dialog and mainwindow.</li>
<li>Fix crashing on decrypting twice.</li>
<li>Update GPG binaries to 1.4.11</li>

<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>2010-06-19:</strong> Summer, sun and new release. Within not quite a month we present you 
the result of newest polishing and bug-fixing. Viriato showed up and was so kind to provide a spanish 
translation. Many thanks to him and the other translators for updating the translation files.</p>

<p>Added features in version 0.2.4:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Open file from command line</li>
        <li>Added setting to save checked private keys on exit <br/>(kind of "encrypt to self"-behaviour)</li>
        <li>Added link to online-tutorial in help menu</li>
	<li>Added spanish translation</li>
	<li>Added undo to edit-menu</li>	
</ul>
<p>The following bugfixes/changes were made in version 0.2.4:</p>
<ul>
        <li>In save-dialog on exit, don't exit, if cancel is hit.</li>
	<li>Fixed multilingual and multiplatform behaviour of shortcuts.</li>
	<li>Statically build with Qt 4.5 on Debian Sarge again, so it should run on rather old Linux-Distris</li>
	<li>From now on the download files are <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">upx-compressed</a> by default</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore we started the implementation of PGP-MIME-parsing. This implementation is rather incomplete.
We're not sure, if it's working under all circumstances. Also we're not yet satisfied with the GUI, 
so we marked it experimental in the settings dialog. If this warning is not keeping you away from testing, 
and you find errors or non-working PGP-MIME encoded messages, don't hesitate to report.

    <b>NOTE:</b> When you created a key with an earlier version of gpg4usb, you should be aware, that it may only has a keysize of 1024 Bit. You can check this with the key-property dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to the bugreporters. Special thanks go to Kirill for russian translation and lots of testing on russian Windows.</p>

<p><strong>2008-12-17:</strong> We realized that as a side effect of building linux version with glibc &lt; 2.4, gpg4usb also
runs on 2.4 kernels, as used in small linux-distris, like <a href="http://damnsmalllinux.org/">damn-small-linux</a>.
We only had to include a new built gpg-binary for linux. Get the new version from the 
<a href="download.html">download section</a>. Windows executable inlcuded as always.
</p>
</div>

<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>2008-12-15:</strong> A new release! gpg4usb v.0.1.1 is out, a release with minor modifications from our stable 
branch. Get it from our <a href="download.html">download section</a>. New in this version:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>keylist is a table now, so being sortable by email or name</li>
<li>prevent "No Data" error, that occured on decryption in some cases</li>
<li>linux build now done on debian release from 2005 (sarge), so any newer linux distribution should 
be supported (glibc &gt;= 2.3.2)</li>

  we also provide a <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">upx-packed</a> build, which brings the size of
