<h1>Welcome to the gpg4usb-Project!</h1>
<p>gpg4usb is a very easy to use and small portable editor to encrypt and decrypt any text-message or -file
you want.<br /><br />
Our aim is, to give anyone the possibility to send and receive secure encrypted messages anywhere -
on any computer out there, no matter if Microsoft Windows<font size="-3"><sup>(TM)</sup></font> or Linux <!--or *BSD --> is running on it.
Therefore it's usage is self-describing, and the user-interface as simple as possible.<br /><br />
gpg4usb is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">free software</a>, and it is licensed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>. <br /><br />
If you want to give it a try, please get our latest release <a href="gpg4usb-0.2.5.zip">here</a> or visit our <a href="download.html">download-section</a>, get the files and
unzip it onto your usb-pendrive... et voilà: you're done and ready to go!</p>

<p><strong>12/01/2010:</strong></p>
<p>On our homepage we added a documentation howto translate gpg4usb.</p>
</div-->

<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>12/01/2010:</strong> 0.2.5 is out! We proudly present
you a shiny new settings dialog. Its now possible to remember password for
a session and messages encoded "quoted printable" are decoded now. 
Viriato was so kind to send us an italian translation.
The still experimental "decode PGP/MIME" feature allows to open attachments with the 
responsible application. Also we fixed some long outstanding bugs and updated 
gpg-binaries to the latest version. 
Take a look at the <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> or proceed directly to
the <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

<p>Many thanks to our translators for the smooth and quick translation process short before release again. You are great!</p>
<p>New features in version 0.2.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabbed settings dialog</li>
<li>Redo action in edit menu</li>
<li>Optional "remember password" function</li>
<li>Italian translation</li>
<li>Decoding "quoted printable" works now</li>
<li>PGP/MIME attachments provide "open with external application" now. 
PGP/MIME support still considered experimental.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following bugfixes/changes were made in version 0.2.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask before overwriting existing files in file encryption</li>
<li>Syncronize checked keys between file encryption dialog and mainwindow.</li>
<li>Fix crashing on decrypting twice.</li>
<li>Update GPG binaries to 1.4.11</li>
<li>Update the Linux Qt library to 4.7</li>
<li>Static linux build is now done on debian etch, this means libc => 2.3.6 supported.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>19/06/2010:</strong> Summer, sun and new release. Within not quite a month we present you 
the result of newest polishing and bug-fixing. Viriato showed up and was so kind to provide a spanish 
translation. Many thanks to him and the other translators for updating the translation files.</p>

<p>Added features in version 0.2.4:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Open file from command line</li>
        <li>Added setting to save checked private keys on exit <br/>(kind of "encrypt to self"-behaviour)</li>
        <li>Added link to online-tutorial in help menu</li>
	<li>Added spanish translation</li>
	<li>Added undo to edit-menu</li>	
</ul>
<p>The following bugfixes/changes were made in version 0.2.4:</p>
<ul>
        <li>In save-dialog on exit, don't exit, if cancel is hit.</li>
	<li>Fixed multilingual and multiplatform behaviour of shortcuts.</li>
	<li>Statically build with Qt 4.5 on Debian Sarge again, so it should run on rather old Linux-Distris</li>
	<li>From now on the download files are <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">upx-compressed</a> by default</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore we started the implementation of PGP-MIME-parsing. This implementation is rather incomplete.
We're not sure, if it's working under all circumstances. Also we're not yet satisfied with the GUI, 
so we marked it experimental in the settings dialog. If this warning is not keeping you away from testing, 
and you find errors or non-working PGP-MIME encoded messages, don't hesitate to report.
</p>

<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>02/05/2010:</strong> Settings, Qt 4.5 and Português do Brasil: We added a settings dialog, fixed 
  a bug in file encryption and added Brazilian translation (many thanks to Alessandro for this). Furthermore 
  we updated to Qt 4.5.</p> 
<p>Added features in version 0.2.3:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Added settings dialog</li>
        <li>Added brazilian translation</li>
</ul>
<p>The following bugfixes/changes were made in version 0.2.3:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Updated to Qt 4.5</li>
        <li>Fixed bug in file encryption, that file is encrypted for checked, not the selected keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again many thanks to the bugreporters. This time goes a special thanks to Alessandro for brazilian 
  translation.</p>

<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>03/02/2010:</strong> Encodings, charsets and Шифрование: We rounded up a new release, 
  repaired bugs dealing with non ascii encodings and also bring you a new translation. Thanks to Kirill 
  you are now able to use gpg4usb with a russian interface. Furthermore you are now able to view key-properties and export private keys.<br/>
  </p><p>
  Added features in version 0.2.2:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added key-property-dialog in key management</li>
	<li>Added export of private key</li>
	<li>Added russian translation</li>
	<li>Added warn message for key deletion</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally the following bugs were fixed in version 0.2.2:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed the keydb not found error, when umlauts, cyrillic and other special characters are in the pathname.</li>
    <li>Set minimum keysize to 768 Bit (required by gnupg for el-gamal subkey)</li>
    <li>Keysize-Bug fixed. Now when generating a key, the key has correct size<br/>
    <b>NOTE:</b> When you created a key with an earlier version of gpg4usb, you should be aware, that it may only has a keysize of 1024 Bit. You can check this with the key-property dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to the bugreporters. Special thanks go to Kirill for russian translation and lots of testing on russian Windows.</p>
</div>

<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>17/12/2008:</strong> We realized that as a side effect of building linux version with glibc &lt; 2.4, gpg4usb also
runs on 2.4 kernels, as used in small linux-distris, like <a href="http://damnsmalllinux.org/">damn-small-linux</a>.
We only had to include a new built gpg-binary for linux. Get the new version from the 
<a href="download.html">download section</a>. Windows executable inlcuded as always.
</p>
</div>

<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>15/12/2008:</strong> A new release! gpg4usb v.0.1.1 is out, a release with minor modifications from our stable 
branch. Get it from our <a href="download.html">download section</a>. New in this version:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>keylist is a table now, so being sortable by email or name</li>
<li>prevent "No Data" error, that occured on decryption in some cases</li>
<li>linux build now done on debian release from 2005 (sarge), so any newer linux distribution should 
be supported (glibc &gt;= 2.3.2)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="newsentry">
<p><strong>23/08/2008:</strong> After a hint from Yucca from the
  <a href="http://portablefreeware.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=13563#13563">portablefreeware forum</a>
  we also provide a <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">upx-packed</a> build, which brings the size of
  the unzipped program down to 9mb. Its available from our <a href="download.html">download section</a>.
</p>
